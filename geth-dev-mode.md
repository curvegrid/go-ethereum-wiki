geth has a development mode which sets up a single node Ethereum test network along with a number of helpful options. It can be enabled with a single command line option, `geth --dev`.

Here's a summary of what geth dev mode does:

* Initializes the data directory with a testing genesis block
* Sets max peers to 0
* Turns off discovery by other nodes
* Sets the gas price to 0
* Uses a testing consensus algorithm (proof of work) which generates blocks quickly
* Prevents the consensus (proof of work) difficulty from ever increasing

## geth dev mode basics

You will need to create and specify a data directory for dev mode.

```sh
$ mkdir test-chain-dir
$ geth --dev --datadir test-chain-dir console
```

Once geth is running, create a test account.

```sh
> personal.newAccount()
Passphrase: 
Repeat passphrase: 
INFO [06-25|00:51:55] New wallet appeared                      url=keystore:///tmpâ€¦ status=Locked
"0x42a3f741fa25e52c618854e7a002ff7c7985b044"
>
```

Then start the miner to mine some blocks. The coinbase will have automatically been set to the test account so the mined Ether will be deposited there. You can verify this by running `eth.coinbase`.

```sh
> miner.start()
INFO [06-25|00:52:45] Updated mining threads                   threads=0
INFO [06-25|00:52:45] Transaction pool price threshold updated price=0
INFO [06-25|00:52:45] Starting mining operation

INFO [06-25|00:52:51] Mining too far in the future             wait=2s
```

And after a few seconds, stop the miner.

```sh
> miner.stop()
INFO [06-25|00:52:53] Commit new mining work                   number=9 txs=0 uncles=0 elapsed=2.002s
true
> 
```

Now check the balance in your test account.

```sh
> web3.fromWei(eth.getBalance(personal.listAccounts[0]), "ether")
40
> 
```

Our test account has 40 Ether in it, which at 5 Ether per block means it mined 8 blocks in 8 seconds on a contemporary iMac, including generating the [DAG][what-is-a-dag].

## Test network alternatives

Instead of geth dev mode, you could use a private test network:

* [Private network](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Private-network)
* [Setting up private network or local cluster](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Setting-up-private-network-or-local-cluster)

Or you could run one of the public test networks. It would mean exposing your smart contract to the network in addition to incurring all of the performance and capacity implications associated with public test networks.

Alternatively, one could use the main network, at a cost (June 2017: Ethereum transactions cost about US$0.30 each).
